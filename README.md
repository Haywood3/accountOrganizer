# Account Organizer Project

This is an Account Organizer. This is meant to manage the who, what, where, when, how, and why of 
all your accounts. I have separated accounts and subscriptions based on how I pay them. The accounts 
are paid through checking and the subscriptions through a credit card.

I've broken down them down into four categories(dropdown): home, utilities, credit, and auto. I also have the 
frequency of payment (dropdown), due dates (text), method(dropdown), payment (text), direct link to company 
website, credit limit (for c/c), owe(d)(for c/c and other accounts), paperless(checkbox), auto pay(checkbox), 
and paid off(checkbox).

I also have subscription and auto pay form. I have separated them, because all of the subscription charges are 
"auto-pay", "recurring", and are charged to a credit card until you make a change. If the account is inactive 
the text color is lightened.

I have the auto pay on both forms, because AEP charges a fee to pay online. If you sign up for auto pay 
there's no fee.

I would like to add sorting to the campany, category, due date, and payment. I think lightening the text color 
and removing the second option response for paperless, auto pay, and paid off makes the page look cleaner

I would like to add login/registration. 

I would like to improve the overall look.
